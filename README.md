monokaize
=========

Monokai-themed user stylesheet (.css) for improved plain HTML reading experience

## Why?

A lot of documentation and many e-books are served in plain HTML. Common everyday browsers use rather unpleasant defaults for plain HTML documents with no stylesheets specified, including but not limited to eye-hurting pure white background.

## Goals

- To provide an improved reading experience on plain-html documentation, e-books, etc
- Honour the Monokai color scheme
- Maximum readability and eye comfort
- Some semantic highlighting for eye-candy and ease of mental parsing, e.g. hyperlinks, citations, pre-formatted code
- Real cross-browser and cross-platform compatibility without resorting to huge boilerplates or kludgy javascript hackery
